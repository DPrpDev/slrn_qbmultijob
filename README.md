# SLRN Multijob - App for LB-Phone

A simple lb-phone application to manage the native [qbx_core](https://github.com/qbox-project/qbx_core) multijob. It does not manage multigang, if you wish to do that then you will need to modify the script yourself.

# Support
- No support is provided but you can ask questions in the lb-phone or qbox discord and someone may chime in.
